#
# Note: The A/B cutoff has historically been in the low 80s/high 70s.
# Participation in lecture and recitation can lead to grade flexibility.

# | Final                          | 35%    |

# üìù Course Content
# ----------------
# Mathematical introduction to the theory of computing. Rigorously explores what kinds of tasks can be efficiently solved with computers by way of finite automata, circuits, Turing machines, and communication complexity, introducing students to some major open problems in mathematics. Builds skills in classifying computational tasks in terms of their difficulty. Discusses other fundamental issues in computing, including the Halting Problem, the Church-Turing Thesis, the P versus NP problem, and the power of randomness.

# Example Usage:
# To calculate the final grade, use the `fundamentals_of_programming` instance.
# Ensure to update each Task's `grade` attribute with the actual scores.

# Example:
# # Update Lab grades
# for i, lab in enumerate(fundamentals_of_programming.grading_groups[0].tasks):
#     lab.grade = obtained_score / max_score  # e.g., 3.7 / 4
#
# # Update Participation grades
# for i, reading in enumerate(fundamentals_of_programming.grading_groups[1].tasks):
#     reading.grade = 0.83  # Assuming full participation
#
# # Update Exam grades
# fundamentals_of_programming.grading_groups[2].tasks[0].grade = 80 / 100  # Midterm score
# fundamentals_of_programming.grading_groups[3].tasks[0].grade = 90 / 100  # Final exam score
#
# # Handle missed readings (y and z adjustments)
# # This requires additional logic to shift weights from Participation to Midterm and Final
#
# final_grade = fundamentals_of_programming.calculate_final_grade()
# print(f"Final Grade: {final_grade}%")
